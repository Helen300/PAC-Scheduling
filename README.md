# PAC-Scheduling: http://pac-schedule.herokuapp.com/

Princeton Dance is a web application catered towards dancers at Princeton University to view and book dance studios for rehearsals and other practice sessions. It is a centralized online system to clearly view the availability of dance studios on campus.

Princeton Dance also features a scheduling component that allows the Performing Arts Council (PAC) to input requests from dance groups for dance rehearsal spaces. These requests are put through our scheduling algorithm to output semeserly schedules of dance studio availabilities for all students to view online.

This application was built with Django and is served on a Heroku server.
